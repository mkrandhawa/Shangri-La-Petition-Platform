# Shangri-La-Petition-Platform

Welcome to the Shangri-La Petitions Website. Please follow the instructions in each folder (frontend and Backend) to learn more about how to run the website. 

# Website Link
If you would not like to manually run the servers on you laptop, the live version of the website is available at:
[SHANGRI-LA PETITIONS](https://shangri-la-petitions-mk747.netlify.app/)

## Few things to consider if you want to use your phone:
- The functionality to use JWT or cookies will not work if you have "**Prevent Cross-Site Tracking**" active!
- As the website length is full screen, you will have to scroll up.
 

# !IMPORTANT
If you are cloning this repository from GITHUB, it *will not* have the .env files. Therefore you would be required to add them manually!.
This has been done for security purposes.

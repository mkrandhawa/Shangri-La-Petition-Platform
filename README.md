# Shangri-La-Petition-Platform

Welcome to the Shangri-La Petitions Website.

## How to start
You have two options : 

- [ ] Run the files manually and for that please follow the instructions in each folder (frontend and Backend) to learn more about how to run the website. 
- [ ] If you would not like to manually run the servers on you laptop, the live version of the website is available at:
[SHANGRI-LA PETITIONS](https://shangri-la-petitions-mk747.netlify.app/)

## Few things to consider if you want to use your phone with the live version:
- The functionality to use JWT or cookies will not work if you have "**Prevent Cross-Site Tracking**" active!
- To deactivate go to Settings --> Safari --> Privacy & Security --> Prevent Cross-Site Tracking - decativate it!
- As the website length is full screen, you will have to scroll up.
 

# !IMPORTANT
If you are cloning this repository from GITHUB, it ***will not*** have the .env files. Therefore you would be required to add them manually!.
This has been done for security purposes.
